I recently graduated from <strong>University of California, Irvine</strong> with my Bachelor's of Science in <strong>Computer Science</strong>.

I studied extensively about <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong> during undergrad. Late in my junior year, I entered my first hackathon and
found out that I really enjoyed creating websites. That was when I decided I wanted to become a <strong>Full Stack Web Developer</strong>. Ever since then, I've been creating personal websites to learn web development while pursuing my degree.

Although, I'm a proficient full-stack developer, I would love to gain expertise in all branches of web development. I love solving real customer
problems with a business justification. <strong>I'm looking for an entry-level contributor role</strong> where I can collaborate with
a team and gain enterprise experience with web design, architecture, and building scalable backend services.

What I love besides tech:

- Calisthenics 🤸
- Food 🍛
- Stocks 📈
