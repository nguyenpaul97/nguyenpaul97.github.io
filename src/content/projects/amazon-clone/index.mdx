Inspired by Amazon, I built a full-stack progressive web app with full e-commerce functionality.
Features include: accounts and login page, product page, cart and checkout page, real payments using <strong><a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank">Stripe
API software</a></strong> and Order History.
